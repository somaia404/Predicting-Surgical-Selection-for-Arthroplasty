# ðŸ“‚ Source Code Overview

This folder contains all the scripts required to run the NLP pipeline for predicting surgical selection from radiology reports. Each script has a specific role in the workflow:

- **`__init__.py`**  
  Marks the folder as a Python package to allow modular imports.

- **`data_loader.py`**  
  Loads the dataset (CSV format), maps binary labels (`Yes/No` â†’ `1/0`), applies text augmentation where required, and prepares stratified folds using `StratifiedKFold` for balanced cross-validation.

- **`model_trainer.py`**  
  Handles model initialization (e.g., GatorTron, ClinicalBERT), tokenizer loading, and training loops. It also manages cross-validation, learning rate scheduling, and checkpoint saving.

- **`evaluation_and_plotting.py`**  
  Computes and visualises performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUROC. Generates confusion matrices, ROC curves, and training/validation loss plots.

- **`private_data_processing/`**  
  Contains R scripts used for initial data linkage and cleaning within the SHAIP secure environment. All scripts are de-identified and contain no private patient information.

âœ… Together, these scripts form a **reproducible pipeline** for model training, evaluation, and result interpretation.
