# Mini Report: Data Linkage Pipeline

## Project Title
**Linking Pre-operative Radiology Reports to PROMs for Hip Replacement Patients**

## Purpose
This project aims to determine whether pre-operative radiology reports and images can be used to predict patient-reported outcomes (PROMs) following hip and knee replacement surgery. This script focuses on the **data linkage phase** using R.

## Data Sources Used
- `SMR01` â€” Hospital admissions (used to identify surgical episodes)
- `OPERA` â€” Surgical operations data (to confirm hip procedures)
- `PROMs` â€” 6-month post-op outcome data (e.g., EQ-VAS scores)
- `Radiology reports` â€” Text-based radiologist findings before surgery

All datasets were mock/test data and no identifiable information was uploaded.

## Pipeline Overview (`linkage_pipeline.R`)
1. **Load all datasets** using `readr::read_csv()`
2. **Standardise CHI identifiers** (trim white space, convert to character)
3. **Remove duplicates** and rows with missing key fields
4. **Standardise fields** (e.g., SIDE field in OPERA)
5. **Convert dates safely** with `lubridate::ymd()`
6. **Merge OPERA with SMR01** to identify surgical episodes
7. **Link PROMs data** using CHI, filtered to 6-month outcomes only
8. **Link radiology reports** and restrict to pre-op only
9. **Export final dataset** with selected variables for modelling

    end

    subgraph Output["Processed & Linked Data"]
        CSV[Unified Linked Dataset<br>(De-identified CSV for AI Modeling)]
    end

    RR --> CHI
    SMR --> CHI
    OP --> CHI
    PR --> CHI
    CHI --> TL
    TL --> CSV

```
## Output
- `linked_clean_dataset.csv`  
  Final pre-processed, linked dataset (not uploaded to GitHub due to SHAIP data rules)

## Notes
- Data linkage was performed using **CHI** as the unique identifier
- Script designed for **secure environments** â€” no real data is uploaded or shared
