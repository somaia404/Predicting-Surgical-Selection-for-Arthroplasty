# ü¶¥ Hip Replacement Data Linkage Pipeline (SHAIP NLP Strand)

This repository contains the R code for linking multiple datasets in preparation for NLP-based modelling of Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) following hip replacement surgery. It is part of the SHAIP/ARCHERY project, focusing on predicting post-operative outcomes using pre-operative radiology reports.

## üìÅ Files

- `linkage_pipeline.R`: Core R script to clean, standardise, and link datasets.
- `mini_report.md`: Summary of the key linkage steps and their rationale.
- `linked_clean_dataset.csv`: Final clean dataset ready for analysis *(mock version or omitted if sensitive)*.
- `mock_*.csv`: Mock datasets used for testing the linkage process.

##  Workflow Overview

### 1. Data Loading
- Imports surgical (OPERA), admission (SMR01), radiology, and PROMs datasets.

### 2. Pre-processing
- Standardises CHI format.
- Removes rows with missing or duplicate CHI values.
- Ensures dates and text fields are cleaned.

### 3. Cohort Identification
- Filters relevant hip replacement records from OPERA using operation codes and side.

### 4. Dataset Linkage
- Links OPERA with SMR01 to enrich surgical context.
- Joins PROMs using CHI and filters to 6-month follow-up scores.
- Ensures radiology reports are pre-operative.

### 5. Final Output
- Assembles a clean, linked dataset with key variables: operation date, side, report text, and EQ-VAS score.

##  Purpose

The cleaned dataset will be used to develop NLP models (e.g., GatorTron, SciSpacy) to:
- Predict EQ-VAS score and MCID attainment
- Explore text-based features associated with outcomes
- Evaluate model interpretability and performance
