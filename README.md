Predicting Surgical Selection for Arthroplasty: A Comparative Analysis of NLP Models
Author: Somaia Elsheikhi
Course: PU5926/PU5927 Professional Placement in Health Data Science (2024/25)
1. Project Summary
This project investigates the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to predict the selection of patients for arthroplasty (joint replacement surgery) based on pre-operative clinical radiology reports. The core objective is to evaluate the performance of the advanced GatorTron transformer model on this classification task using a rigorous cross-validation approach.
A Note on Data Privacy: The project workflow was developed in two stages. The initial data linkage was performed on a private, sensitive NHS dataset (SHARP project). To ensure reproducibility, the core NLP modeling pipeline was then developed and validated using the publicly available MIMIC-III dataset.
2. Project Workflow & Repository Structure
The repository is structured to reflect the two main stages of the project.
Part A: Sensitive Data Processing (Demonstration Only)
Code: src/private_data_processing/linkage_pipeline.R
Description: This R script was used for cleaning and linking the sensitive SHARP dataset. This code is for demonstration only and cannot be run.
Report: A summary of this process is available in reports/mini_report.md.
Part B: Reproducible NLP Modeling Pipeline (MIMIC-III)
Code: The primary analysis is in the Jupyter Notebook: notebooks/02_GatorTron_Model_Evaluation.ipynb. A preceding notebook, notebooks/01_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb, should be run first to prepare the data.
Description: This is the main, reproducible part of the project. It uses the public MIMIC-III dataset to train and evaluate the GatorTron model.
3. How to Reproduce the Analysis
To run the public-facing analysis (Part B), please follow these steps in order:
a. Clone Repository & Install Dependencies
bash
git clone https://github.com/somaia404/Predicting-Surgical-Selection-for-Arthroplasty.git
cd Predicting-Surgical-Selection-for-Arthroplasty
pip install -r requirements.txt
b. Download MIMIC-III Data
Access to the MIMIC-III dataset is required. Please request access from PhysioNet and place the relevant files (e.g., NOTEEVENTS.csv) in the data/mimic_data/ directory. See data/README.md for more details.
c. Run the Notebooks
The analysis is split into two notebooks. Please run them in the following order from the notebooks/ directory:
01_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb: This will process the raw MIMIC data and save a clean version for modeling.
02_GatorTron_Model_Evaluation.ipynb: This will load the processed data and run the full model training, cross-validation, and evaluation.
The final results and figures will be generated by the second notebook.
