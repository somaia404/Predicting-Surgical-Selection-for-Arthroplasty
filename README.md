# Predicting Surgical Selection for Arthroplasty: A Comparative Analysis of NLP Models

This project investigates the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to predict patient surgical selection from pre-operative radiology reports. The core objective is to evaluate the performance of advanced transformer models on this classification task, using a rigorous cross-validation approach to ensure reproducibility and robustness.

The project was built upon a foundational code script generously provided by **Dr. Luke Farrow**, which served as the starting point for this analysis. We also thank the developers of **PyTorch**, **Hugging Face**, **scikit-learn**, and other open-source libraries that made this work possible.

## 1️⃣ Project Workflow & Repository Structure

The repository is structured to reflect the project's workflow:

- - `src/` : Contains all refactored Python scripts for data loading, modeling, and evaluation.  
  - Includes a `private_data_processing/` subfolder with R scripts used for initial data linkage (no patient identifiers included).  
- `notebooks/` : Stores Jupyter notebooks used for initial model development and exploratory analysis.  
- `data/` : Placeholder for the dataset. The original SHARP dataset cannot be shared. A **synthetic dataset** that mimics its statistical properties is provided for reproducibility.  
- `models/` : Directory for saved model weights (not committed to GitHub).  
- `images/` : Contains exported figures such as dashboards, confusion matrices, and ROC curves for the README.

## 2️⃣ Acknowledged Contributions and Modifications

This project builds upon the original work to create a more robust and comprehensive machine learning pipeline. The key modifications include:

- **Synthetic Data Generation**: A Python script was developed to generate a realistic, synthetic dataset of clinical text and patient outcomes, enabling a fully reproducible analysis while protecting patient privacy.  
- **Enhanced Code Structure**: The code was refactored into distinct, logical sections for data generation, model setup, training, and evaluation.  
- **Improved Evaluation Workflow**: The script now calculates and reports overall average metrics and their 95% confidence intervals across all cross-validation folds.  
- **Comprehensive Visualization**: New plotting functions were added to generate an aggregated ROC curve, average confusion matrix, and a calibration plot.  
- **Increased Robustness**: The script now includes error handling for critical operations like file loading.

## 3️⃣ Key Findings and Model Performance

The most effective strategy was combining the **RoBERTa model with data augmentation**, as demonstrated by the metrics from a 3-fold cross-validation run.

| Model Variant                              | F1 Score | Accuracy | Recall  | Precision |
|--------------------------------------------|----------|----------|---------|-----------|
| RoBERTa + Data Augmentation                | 0.6917   | 0.5485   | 0.9779  | 0.5355    |
| RoBERTa + Data Augmentation + Weight Decay | 0.6886   | 0.5462   | 0.9691  | 0.5351    |
| GatorTron + Class Weighting                | 0.5249   | 0.4452   | 0.8762  | 0.3771    |
| GatorTron Baseline                         | 0.5244   | 0.4593   | 0.8564  | 0.3779    |
| RoBERTa + Class Weighting                  | 0.5199   | 0.4365   | 0.8746  | 0.3703    |

The analysis revealed that while **data augmentation** significantly improved the model's ability to identify positive cases (high recall), it did so with a notable trade-off in **precision**. The model frequently produced false positives, which is a key area for future improvement.
